### Project Title
Bike Share Data Analysis Project

### Description
In this project, you will use Python to analyze data from bike-sharing systems in three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. The program loads the data and answers various insightful questions by calculating descriptive statistics. It also includes an interactive command-line interface that allows users to explore the data dynamically.

### Files Used
CSV files containing city-specific bikeshare data:
- `chicago.csv`
- `new_york_city.csv`
- `washington.csv`

### Roadmap
- Add visualization of trip data on maps  
- Support additional cities and datasets  
- Improve user interface for better interactivity  
- Refactor code for better modularity and testability  
- Add unit tests and automated testing workflow
