### Project Title
Bike Share Data Analysis Project

### Description
This project analyzes bike-sharing data from three major U.S. cities — Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. Using Python, the project processes datasets containing trip information and calculates descriptive statistics such as popular travel times, stations, trip durations, and user demographics. It also includes an interactive command-line interface that allows users to explore these statistics dynamically.

### Files used
- `chicago.csv` — Chicago bike share data  
- `new_york_city.csv` — New York City bike share data  
- `washington.csv` — Washington, D.C. bike share data
