### Project Title
Bike Share Data Analysis Project

### Description
This project analyzes bike-sharing data from three major U.S. cities — Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. Using Python, the project processes datasets containing trip information and calculates descriptive statistics such as popular travel times, stations, trip durations, and user demographics. It also includes an interactive command-line interface that allows users to explore these statistics dynamically.

## Data Description
The datasets contain detailed trip records from three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. The data covers the first six months of 2017 and includes information such as:

- **Start Time:** Timestamp when the trip began (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)  
- **End Time:** Timestamp when the trip ended (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)  
- **Trip Duration:** Duration of the trip in seconds (e.g., 776)  
- **Start Station:** Name of the station where the trip started  
- **End Station:** Name of the station where the trip ended  
- **User Type:** Indicates whether the user is a Subscriber or Customer  

For Chicago and New York City, the datasets also include:  

- **Gender:** User's gender (Male/Female)  
- **Birth Year:** Year of birth of the user  

The original datasets were cleaned and condensed to focus on these core columns, removing extraneous data to facilitate easier and faster analysis.
